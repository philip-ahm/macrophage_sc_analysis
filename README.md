**Short title + project description:** Single-cell analysis of the differences in gene expression and function of macrophages and macrophages subtypes in mice and humans with atherosclerose. 

Atherosclerose is a heterogeneous disease in which plaques are developed on the inside of the arteries which can cause arteriosclerosis and strokes. In the development of these plaques, the immune system plays a significant role, specifically macrophages. According to Mokry et al. [1], there are five different types of plaques, each with their own biomarker profile, macrophage subtypes and a difference in proportions of available macrophagesubtypes. However, as of yet it is unknown how these macrophagesubtypes play a role in the development of plaques. Therefore the goal of this project is to research the difference in gene expressions and function of macrophages and macrophagesubtypes mice and humans with atherosclerose. To do this, single-cell data of each organism is used to be able to research in detail which immune cells are involved with the development of plaques.
