**Short title + project description:** Comparative single-cell analysis of
macrophages and macrophage subtypes in
atherosclerotic mice and humans


Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven inflammatory disease affecting more than 500 million people yearly. It is
characterized by plaque formation within the arteries that can lead to blocked arteries and strokes. Risk
factors include a high concentration of LDL and a low concentration of HDL. Additionally, excess LDL is
prone to oxidation in the arteries, which can attract monocytes that differentiate into macrophages that
can either be atheroprotective or atherogenic, depending on their phenotype. Currently, there are suggested
to be six distinct macrophage subtypes: resident-like macrophages, inflammatory macrophages, LAMs,
iLAMs, IFNIC macrophages, and proliferating macrophages. To study macrophage heterogeneity, mouse
models are used due to the ability to study atherosclerosis in a controlled environment and reduce costs.
Among different genetically modified mouse models, ApoE-/- and LDLR-/- are primarily used to study
macrophage heterogeneity. Tissue samples from these models can be analyzed using scRNA-seq. However,
not all findings using mouse models are translatable to humans. The aim of this study was to analyze and
compare transcriptional differences between atherosclerotic mouse and human macrophages to evaluate the
translational value of using mouse as a model organism in human atherosclerosis research. To achieve this,
atherosclerotic plaque samples were collected and analyzed using a well-established scRNA-seq workflow.
Analysis revealed that the resident-like macrophages, inflammatory macrophages, and LAMs were largely
conserved across species. In contrast, the iLAMs, and IFNIC macrophages showed several species-specific
differentially expressed genes. Additionally, the proliferating macrophages were not found in the mouse
macrophage populations. Despite several methodological limitations, these findings suggest that mouse
models show promising translatability of macrophage findings to humans in atherosclerosis research.
